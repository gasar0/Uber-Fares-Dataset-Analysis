# Uber Fares Dataset Analysis using Power BI

## Project Overview

This project analyzes Uber ride data to uncover patterns in fare pricing, ride patterns, and operational metrics. Using a dataset of 200,000 Uber rides, I performed comprehensive data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and created an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize key insights.
